TinyFugue for Mac OS X

You must have the developer tools installed on your system.
Open a shell window, and follow the instructions in unix/README.

TinyFugue for Win32

The likely best option for running TinyFugue under Winows is to
get 'Windows Subsystem for Linux'. This should be straight-forward
and give you an almost identical experience to a TinyFugue on UNIX
like systems, but it has not yet been tested.

Once installed, open a shell window, and follow the instructions in
unix/README.

Older note on TinyFugue for Win32 (not the recommended option)

The official release of TF for win32 is available only in source form.
To compile it, you will need the Cygwin Development Kit (cdk.exe),
available at http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/.  Once you have the
CDK installed, follow the instructions for compiling TF under UNIX.

Unofficial binary releases may be available.  Check
http://tinyfugue.sourceforge.net/ for more information.

There are several known problems with the win32 version of tf, mostly due
to shortcomings of cygwin:
 * Scrolling in visual mode is jumpy.
 * /quote ! (and code that calls it, like /sys) is not supported.
 * $COMPRESS_READ is not supported.
 * Nonblocking hostname resolution (%gethostbyname) is not supported.
 * The flash attribute (-af) does not work.

Note that TF (and all cygwin applications) use "//X" notation instead of
"X:" to indicate drives in paths, and slashes instead of backslashes
to separate path components.  For example, a DOS path of "C:\foo\bar"
should be written "//c/foo/bar" in cygwin.

TiyFugue for OS/2

Theoretically this is still supported, but it seems unlikely anyone will
still be looking for this. Since this requires additional files, it's
likely to slowly diverge from the rest of the code. It may very well be
removed from the release line of this repo, but the old files would
remain tracked and preserved for the future.
