This fork of TinyFugue is currently being supported by Kruton,
Sketch, and wstarter. It also inclues assorted patches developed
by various community members in the years since TF saw saw it's
final release.

For a long time TinyFugue was written, maintained, and copyrighted
by Ken Keys ("Hawkeye"), who can be reached by email at kkeys@ucsd.edu.
His final release was 50b8 in January 2007, but he is still active
in giving support at https://sourceforge.net/p/tinyfugue

See the file "COPYING" for the full copyright and license.

Support for OS/2 was contributed by Andreas Sahlbach (asa@stardiv.de).

TinyFugue versions 1.5.3 and earlier were written by Greg Hudson
("Explorer_Bob"), without whom I would have never gotten into this mess.

TinyFugue was intially derived from tinytalk, a unix client written by
Anton Rang ("Tarrant") and modified by Leo Plotkin ("Grod").

Additional thanks to Jeff Prothero ("Cynbe"), Bruce Sterling Woodcock
("Bruce"), David Moore ("OliverJones"), Ben Jackson ("Ben"), the mudders of
glia.biostr.washington.edu, and everyone else who tested, found bugs,
or came up with suggestions, and to Jim Lick ("Jingoro") for providing
tcp.com services.
