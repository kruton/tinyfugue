Unicode notes:
  ICU is the branch you want.
  On Debian or Ubuntu, make sure you apt-get libicu-dev before running
  ./configure. You'll need to manually add -licuuc to src/Makefile before
  starting make.
  Please be aware there are some bugs, but there should be no crashbugs.

                       INSTALLING TINYFUGUE

TinyFugue can be installed and run on UNIX-like systems, Mac OS X, OS/2,
and Win32.  For instructions, see the README file in the appropriate
directory.  For information on unofficial versions of TF for other
operating systems, see the TF web page at http://tinyfugue.sourceforge.net/.

Note that the .tar.gz and .tar.Z distributions contain LF line delimiters,
intended for UNIX, and the .zip distribution contains CR LF delimiters,
intended for OS/2.  It is possible to convert line delimiters, but it's
easier to just get a distribution that already has the correct delimiters.


"Make" options
--------------

Options are not available on all systems.  To use an option, give it as
an argument to the installation program (e.g., "make clean").

 all		Compile, but do not install (the "install" option should be
			run later to install the files).
 install	Compile (if you haven't already) and install.  The default
			installation locations depend on the operating system.
 clean		Remove object files and other junk from source directory.
 uninstall	Remove tf executable, help files, and library from their
			installed locations.


Public Installation
-------------------

Some features of TF can be disabled for secure public installation, by
using one of these /restrict commands in %{TFLIBDIR}/local.tf:

    /restrict SHELL  Prevents all access to shell or external commands.
                     Disables TF builtins "/sh" and "/quote !", and
                     uncompression during /load and /help.

    /restrict FILE   Prevents reading and writing of files.  Disables
                     TF builtins "/load", "/save", "/saveworld", "/log",
                     and "/quote '", and sockmload feature.
                     Implies /restrict shell.

    /restrict WORLD  Prevents the user from defining new worlds and
                     connecting to undefined worlds.  TF builtins
                     /addworld and the "/world <host> <port>" semantics
                     are disabled.  Implies /restrict file.


Terminal Handling
-----------------

If the default terminal handling option does not work, tf can be
configured to use vt100 codes or nothing at all.  See the README
file in the subdirectory corresponding to your operating system.


Compression
-----------

If you are short on disk space, you can compress the helpfile and
library files (except stdlib.tf).  Make sure the COMPRESS_SUFFIX
and COMPRESS_READ macros are set correctly; set them in the
%{TFLIBDIR}/local.tf file if needed.  Note that compresion can not
be used if /restrict is used.


Firewalls
---------

TF can be made to connect through a generic proxy server by setting
the %proxy_host variable at runtime.  See "/help proxy".

Also see the README file in the subdirectory corresponding to your
operating system to see if tf has transparent firewall support on your
system.


Last Resort
-----------

If you have an installation problem or other system-specific problem
that is not described in this README or the README in the subdirectory
for your system, contact the person who supports TF on your system.  If
you have a problem that is not system-related, ask for support on
http://tinyfugue.sourceforge.net/ or contact the author by email at
kenkeys@users.sourceforge.net.  Please provide the following information:

    The version of TF (type "/version" in tf).
    The operating system version (on unix, type "uname -a" in the shell).
    If tf won't compile, send the output of configure and make (in plaintext
        form, please).
    If you have a bug or core, give ALL error messages from tf.
    If you have a bug or core, describe what you did or what happened
        before the problem, and if the problem is repeatable.
    If you have a core file, do NOT send it.


Porting
-------

I have no personal interest in Mac OS 9, DOS, Windows 95, Windows NT, or
Amiga, so I don't plan on porting to them.  However, I am willing to
work with someone who wants to try and is willing to follow my
guidelines (this is how the OS/2 version was created, and why it is an
official version which continues to grow).  Basically, this means
keeping the platform-specific code seperate and to a minimum, and not
adding new features.
