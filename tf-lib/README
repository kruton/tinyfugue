                   Interesting and useful macros

The *.tf files in this directory contain many interesting and useful
macros.  Some are quite useful, others illustrate useful macro
programming techniques.  Any of the *.tf files can be loaded directly
with /load.  Read the comments at the top of each file for specific
instructions.
